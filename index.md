It may be helpful to know that you can *italicize* text with single-asterisks
(or alternatively, using _underscores_),
and that you can **bold** text using double-asterisks.

If you want to insert a link, use `[` in order to delimit the text that you wish
to appear in the web-UI, and after closing the text with `]`insert the URL in a
set of `()`, e.g. [here is a link to ICME's

## About the Instructor

![Andreas Santucci](/assets/img/profile.jpg){:style="max-width:30%;"}

Andreas Santucci graduated from Stanford in 2017 with a degree in Computational
and Mathematical Engineering. During his time at Stanford, Andreas did
causal-inference research with 
[Guido Imbens](https://imbens.people.stanford.edu/), who was named a Nobel
Laureate in 2021, and also aced qualifying exams in his favorite subjects
including Discrete Mathematics and Algorithms as well as Stochastic Processes.

Andreas is currently taking on multiple roles within industry and academia
simultaneously:
  * At Google, Andreas is a Data Scientist: he designs state of the art
recommendation algorithms for YouTube, and pursues cutting edge techniques for
statistical inference on sparse data, for example. He also dances the boundary between a SWE/MLE role, often implementing ideas into production himself using (distributed) C++, training models, running live-traffic experiments, etc.
  * At Stanford, Andreas is a Lecturer at [ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/): he teaches a *sequence* of
graduate-level software development courses that showcase advanced usage of
modern C++.
  * At the 
  [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics](https://www.siam.org/): he   serves on the
Education Committee, where the objective is to facilitate getting students
involved with STEM.

# Workshop Materials

## Pre-workshop Checklist

1. Sign up for [Piazza](https://piazza.com/stanford/fall2021/icmeinterviewworkshops) (class code *icme*). We will attempt to host a Piazza page such that you may learn *from each other* after the workshop is over. (*Note that the best time to ask Andreas questions is _during_ the Q&A sessions held at the end of each workshop session).
2. Familiarize yourself with the schedule and see you Monday, October 18th at 7:15 P.M. PST via Zoom!
3. Afterward, you can review the
